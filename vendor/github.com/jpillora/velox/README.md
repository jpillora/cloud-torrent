Real-time JS object synchronisation over SSE and WebSockets in Go and JavaScript (Node.js and browser)

### Features

* Simple API
* Synchronise any JSON marshallable struct in Go
* Synchronise any JSON stringifiable struct in Node
* Delta updates using [JSONPatch (RFC6902)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)
* Supports [Server-Sent Events (EventSource)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) and [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)
* SSE [client-side poly-fill](https://github.com/remy/polyfills/blob/master/EventSource.js) to fallback to long-polling in older browsers (IE8+).
* Implement delta queries (return all results, then incrementally return changes)

### Quick Usage

Server (Go)

``` go
//syncable struct
type Foo struct {
	velox.State
	A, B int
}
foo := &Foo{}
//serve velox.js client library (assets/dist/velox.min.js)
http.Handle("/velox.js", velox.JS)
//serve velox sync endpoint for foo
http.Handle("/sync", velox.SyncHandler(foo))
//make changes
foo.A = 42
foo.B = 21
//push to client
foo.Push()
```

Server (Node)

``` js
//syncable object
let foo = {
	a: 1,
	b: 2
};
//express server
let app = express();
//serve velox.js client library (assets/dist/velox.min.js)
app.get("/velox.js", velox.JS);
//serve velox sync endpoint for foo
app.get("/sync", velox.handle(foo));
//make changes
foo.a = 42;
foo.b = 21;
//push to client
foo.$push();
```

Client (Node and Browser)

``` js
// load script /velox.js
var foo = {};
var v = velox("/sync", foo);
v.onupdate = function() {
	//foo.A === 42 and foo.B === 21
};
```

### API

Server API (Go)

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/velox?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/velox)

Server API (Node)

* `velox.handle(object)` *function* returns `v` - Creates a new route handler for use with express
* `velox.state(object)` *function* returns `state` - Creates or restores a velox state from a given object
* `state.handle(req, res)` *function* returns `Promise` - Handle the provided `express` request/response. Resolves on connection close. Rejects on any error.

Client API (Node and Browser)

* `velox(url, object)` *function* returns `v` - Creates a new SSE velox connection
* `velox.sse(url, object)` *function* returns `v` - Creates a new SSE velox connection
* `velox.ws(url, object)` *function* returns `v` - Creates a new WS velox connection
* `v.onupdate(object)` *function* - Called when a server push is received
* `v.onerror(err)` *function* - Called when a connection error occurs
* `v.onconnect()` *function* - Called when the connection is opened
* `v.ondisconnect()` *function* - Called when the connection is closed
* `v.onchange(bool)` *function* - Called when the connection is opened or closed
* `v.connected` *bool* - Denotes whether the connection is currently open
* `v.ws` *bool* - Denotes whether the connection is in web sockets mode
* `v.sse` *bool* - Denotes whether the connection is in server-sent events mode

*Here is a screenshot from this example page, showing the messages arriving as either a full replacement of the object or just a delta. The server will send which ever is smaller.*

### Notes

* JS object properties beginning with `$` will be ignored to play nice with Angular.
* JS object with an `$apply` function will automatically be called on each update to play nice with Angular.
* `velox.SyncHandler` is just a small wrapper around `velox.Sync`:

	```go
	func SyncHandler(gostruct interface{}) http.Handler {
		return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			if conn, err := Sync(gostruct, w, r); err == nil {
				conn.Wait()
			}
		})
	}
	```

### Known issues

* Object synchronization is currently one way (server to client) only.
* Object diff has not been optimized. It is a simple property-by-property comparison.

### TODO

* WebRTC support
* Plain [`http`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_requestlistener) server support in Node
* WebSockets support in Node
