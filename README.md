### Features

* Single binary
* Cross platform
* Embedded torrent search
* Real-time updates
* Mobile-friendly
* Fast [content server](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeContent)
* External command run on task finished.

```

#### Config

A copy of `cloud-torrent.json` is generated if `--config-path` is not specified, with default config as following content:
```
{
  "AutoStart": true,
  "DisableEncryption": false,
  "DownloadDirectory": "/path/to/downloads",
  "EnableUpload": true,
  "EnableSeeding": false,
  "IncomingPort": 50007,
  "DoneCmd": ""
}
```

#### About DoneCmd

`DoneCmd` is an external command to be called when a task is finished, with infomation set as environment variables:

```
CLD_DIR=/path/to/download
CLD_PATH=Torrent-Downloaded-File-OR-Dir
CLD_SIZE=46578901
CLD_FILECNT=1
```
Please noted that `CLD_PATH` will be a directory if the torrent contians more than one file, as `CLD_FILECNT` is stating the total number of files in the torrent.


### Future features

The next set of [core features can be tracked here](https://github.com/jpillora/cloud-torrent/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acore-feature). This feature set requires large structural changes and therefore requires a complete rewrite for best results. This rewrite is in progress in the `0.9` branch though it will take quite some time.

In summary, the core features will be:

* **Remote backends**

  It's looking like `0.9` will be more of a general purpose cloud transfer engine. It will be capable of transfering files from and source file-system to any destination file-system. A torrent can be viewed a folder with files, just like your local disk, and Dropbox. As long as it has a concept of files and folders, it could potentially be a cloud-torrent file-system backend. Track this issue https://github.com/jpillora/cloud-torrent/issues/24 for the list of proposed backends.

* **File Transforms**

  During a file tranfer, one could apply different transforms against the byte stream for various effect. For example, supported transforms might include: video transcoding (using ffmpeg), encryption and decryption, [media sorting](https://github.com/jpillora/cloud-torrent/issues/4) (file renaming), and writing multiple files as a single zip file.
  
* **Automatic updates** Binary will upgrade itself, adding new features as they get released.
  
* **RSS** Automatically add torrents, with smart episode filter.

Once completed, cloud-torrent will no longer be a simple torrent client and most likely project be renamed.
