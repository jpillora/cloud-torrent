**SimpleTorrent** is a a self-hosted remote torrent client, written in Go (golang). Started torrents remotely, download sets of files on the local disk of the server, which are then retrievable or streamable via HTTP.

This project is a re-branded fork of [cloud-torrent](https://github.com/jpillora/cloud-torrent) by `jpillora`.

# Install

## Binary

See [the latest release](https://github.com/boypt/cloud-torrent/releases/latest) or use the oneline script to do a quick install on a modern Linux machines.

``` bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://git.io/simpletorrentqs)
```

The script installs a systemd unit (under `scripts/cloud-torrent.service`) as service. Read further intructions: [Auth And Security](https://github.com/boypt/simple-torrent/wiki/AuthSecurity)

If hope to specify a version, just append the version number to the command.

``` bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://git.io/simpletorrentqs) 1.3.3
```

## Docker [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/boypt/cloud-torrent.svg)][dockerhub]

[dockerhub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/boypt/cloud-torrent/

``` bash
$ docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/my/downloads:/downloads -v /path/to/my/torrents:/torrents boypt/cloud-torrent
```
When running as a container, keep in mind:
* You need also to expose your torrent incoming port (50007 by default) if you want to seed (`-p 50007:50007`). Also, you'll have to forward the port on your router.
* Automatic port forwarding on your router via UPnP IGD will not work unless run in `host` mode (`--net=host`).

It's more practical to run docker-compose, see Wiki Page: [DockerCompose](https://github.com/boypt/simple-torrent/wiki/DockerCompose)
